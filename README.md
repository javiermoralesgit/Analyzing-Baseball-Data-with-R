The most common way to simulate a baseball game is with Markov Chains. Markov Chains describe the movements between states until three outs are accomplished. States are defined as a description of the number of outs and runners on base.

The hypothetical question I answered based on the code attached to this repository is if I run a half inning Markov Chain simulation 10000 times under the state of a runner on second with no outs how many half innings will have at least 1 runner score. The takeaway from this simulation was that 15% of the half innings have at least 1 runner score.
